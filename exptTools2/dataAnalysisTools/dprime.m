function [dpr,anal] = dprime(responses,answers,varargin);% DPRIME: calculate d prime (ROC analysis), as well as other useful% performance measures, for response data. %% Usage: [dpr,anal] = dprime(responses,answers,[options]);%% args in:%%   responses: vector of size numtrials representing the button %   the subject actually pressed. %%   answers: vector of size numtrials giving the number the %   subject should have pressed to be correct on the given task.%%   Currently, if no key is pressed (or the correct response to a trial%   is not to press a key), this is represented by a 0 in either the%   responses or answers vector. Sometimes stimulus code represents this by%   NaNs; check your code in advance.%%% args out:%%   dpr: measure of dprime for behavioral data%%   anal: struct with fields containing performance measures for the data.%% options: %%   'noKeypressVal',[value]: value in responses/answers which reflects no key was%   pressed. Default = 0.%%   'absentVal',[value]: value in responses/answers which reflects stimulus%   was absent/was reported as absent. Default = 1.%%   'presentVal',[value]: value in responses/answers which reflects%   stimulus was present/was reported as present. Default = 2.%%   'silent': Don't print out the results of analysis in the command%   window.%% This only analyzes responses for those trials in which the subject% pressed a key. Unless the 'silent' option is given, it also prints out% the results of the analysis in the command window.%% For more information on how dprime is calculated and what it means (and% what assumptions it makes), see:%%  http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/sdt/sdt.html%%% 10/03 ras.
